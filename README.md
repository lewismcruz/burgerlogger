### What are the options
To help meet what our customers are looking for in their burgers, Eat Da Burger is implementing a "Devour Da Burger" app that helps rate a burger that was recently ordered.

You can rate the burger by clicking on the "Yummy" button on the Eat Da Burger Burger Logger website (reachable here: Link to page. )

When the "Yummy" button is selected, the burger is rated as "devoured" and should show up on the left of the screen.

Undevoured burgers are moved to the right of the screen.
